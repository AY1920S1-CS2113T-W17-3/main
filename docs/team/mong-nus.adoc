== 1. Overview
This portfolio documents my contributions towards *OwlMoney* for the module CS2113T Software Engineering &
Object-Oriented Programming. It aims to demonstrate the theoretical and practical knowledge I have gained in this module
 over the semester.

== 2. Project: OwlMoney
*OwlMoney* is an application designed to assist undergraduates and fresh graduates to track and manage their finances
conveniently and effectively - all in one place. *OwlMoney* provides a Command Line Interface (CLI) for the user to
interact with. The commands used to interact with *OwlMoney* are designed to be simple and intuitive. Rest assured, you
will be able to use *OwlMoney* with ease, even if you are unfamiliar with CLI.

== 3. Summary of contributions
Below are my contributions in terms of feature enhancements, project management, and documentation:

=== 3.1 Features enhancement

==== 3.1.1 Enhancement added: *Card* feature
* *What it does*: Allows the users to maintain a list of credit cards that they own.

* *Justification*: The *Card* feature work together with the *Card Expenditure* feature and provides the user the
capability of tracking their expenses for each credit card that they own. As such, provides the user with a convenient
way to review their credit card expenses.

* *Highlights*: This enhancement involves adding several new commands to *OwlMoney*. As such it requires an
understanding of the underlying architecture and the components `logic`, `model` and `storage`.

* *Credits: The implementation of *Card* feature was collaborated with Terence, as the implementation of the *Card
Expenditure* feature depends on the implementation of the *Card* feature.

==== 3.1.2 Enhancement added: *Find* feature
* *What it does*: Allows the user to search for specific information such as transaction records, bank account and more.

* *Justification*: It can be messy and tedious for the user to track and manage their finances after using *OwlMoney*
for some time. This is because the user might have thousand of transactions record stored within *OwlMoney*. With the
 *Find* feature, it allows the user to search and view specific transaction records with ease.

* *Highlights*: For this enhancement to be implemented, it depends on other features such
 as *Card*, *Bank*, and *Transaction*. Therefore, the implementation of *Find* feature was challenging as it requires an
 in-depth analysis and understanding of other features.

=== 3.1.3 Enhancement added: *Transfer* feature
* *What it does*: Allows the users to transfer funds from one bank account to another account.

* *Justification*:  It provides the user with great flexibility to transfer funds from one bank account to another bank
account. This helps to simulate a realistic flow of funds between different accounts such as transferring money from
saving account to investment account to invest.

* *Highlights*: For this enhancement to be implemented, it depends on other features such
 as *Bank* and *Transaction*. Therefore, the implementation of *Transfer* feature was challenging as it requires an
 in-depth analysis and understanding of other features.

=== 3.1.4 Enhancement added: *Display* feature
* *What it does*: Allows the users to list their financial information in a neat and tidy table format.

* *Justification*: By listing the financial information such as transaction records or bank account details in a table
 format, it allows the user to review the information with ease. Hence, making our application user-friendly for the
 user.

* *Highlights*: For this enhancement to be implemented, it depends on all other features such
 as *Bank*, *Transaction*, and *Goal*. Therefore, the implementation of *Display* feature was challenging as it requires
 an in-depth analysis and understanding of other features.

== 5. Contributions to the Developer Guide

The following sections below showcase extracts of my contributions to the Developer Guide and my ability to write
documentation targeting end-users with little or no technical knowledge. In this section, it will only
showcase the *Find* feature due to the page limit restriction. You can find more information about other features
implemented by me
link:https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2113T-W17-3/main/blob/master/docs/DeveloperGuide.adoc[here].

=== 5.1 Design for Find Feature

.Find Command Class Diagram
image::FindClassDiagram.png[caption="Figure 8: "]

The `logic.command.find` package consist of `Find` classes with the ability to find any:

* Bank accounts
* Cards
* Bonds
* Card transactions
* Bank transactions
* Recurring Expenditures

`Main` will call the specific `Find` command class that will construct the *required parameters* before calling the
`Profile` class in `Model` to *execute*.

=== 5.2 Implementation for Find feature
The following section describes the specific implementation for *finding of the savings account* and how data flows
across various objects and methods to obtain a successful execution. In this section, we will be showcasing the data
flow of finding a savings account.

.Sequence Diagram for finding savings account
image::sequencediagram.png[caption="Figure 9: "]

[NOTE]
The sequence diagram presented above is assumed to be a valid command which will produce a successful result.

The above sequence diagram depicts the interaction between the `Logic`, `Model` and `Ui` component for running
`FindBankOrCardCommand`.

The `FindBankOrCardCommand` requires *2* inputs:

* Savings Account's name that acts as a keyword for the search.
* Type of item to be searched (e.g. cards, savings or investment account)

When the user executes the `FindBankOrCardCommand`, the following steps are taken by the application:

. When the `FindBankOrCardCommand` is executed, it will invoke `findBankOrCard`.
. Once invoked, `findBankOrCard` will perform the following checks:

* Check the type of items to be searched is either card, savings or investment account.

[start=3]
. After passing the above checks, `findBankOrCard` will invoke `findBankAccount`.
. Within the invocation of `findBankAccount`, it will perform the following checks:

* Check for matching account name with the keyword among all accounts stored in the ArrayList.
* Check whether the account that matches the keyword is indeed a savings account.

[NOTE]
`findBankAccount` will throw an error if all bank accounts within the application fail the above checks.

[start=5]
. Once the search has been completed, the details of the all matching savings account will be displayed to inform the
user of the *successful* matches.

=== 5.3 Design Considerations

This section describes the various design considerations taken when implementing the `/find` feature.

*Aspect: Choice of whether the keyword (E.g. `DESCRIPTION` or `CATEGORY`) to be searched should be case-sensitive or
case-insensitive*

[cols="18%,37%,45%"]
|======
| *Approach* | *Pros* | *Cons*

| *1.* Searching of items based on the keyword is case-sensitive.

a| * By restricting the search to be case-sensitive, it provides user with more accurate searched result.

a| * By having a case-sensitive search, it will cause the `/find` command to be inflexible. As the user will need to
provide the exact capitalisation within the keyword to be able to find the item he/she is searching for.

* For example,if the description of an expenditure that the user is searching for is "Lunch at KFC". The user will not
be able to find the expenditure if he/she provide the keyword as "lunch". This is because the capitalisation of the
first letter within the keyword is "l" and it is different from the expenditure description.

| *2.* Searching of items based on the keyword is case-insensitive.

a| * Provide user with greater flexibility when searching for matching items.

a| * If interest has already been credited, it is not feasible to change the names of past records as it might cause
confusion to the end user. This becomes more apparent when the names clash with the name of another investment bond
which had expired prior to making this edit. This might confuse users as they might think that they earned much more
interest from the same bond.
|======

After weighting the pros and cons, *approach 2* was taken.

The reason for choosing approach 2 over approach 1 is mainly due to the flexibility it can provide to a user. Although,
searching of item with case insensitivity might result in more result being display. We felt that the ability to match
keyword with the item that the user would like to find easily is more important as it make the enhance the
user-friendliness of the user experience when using of our application.
