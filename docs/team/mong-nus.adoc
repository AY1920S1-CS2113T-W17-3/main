== Overview
This portfolio documents my contributions towards *OwlMoney* for the module CS2113T Software Engineering &
Object-Oriented Programming. It aims to demonstrate the theoretical and practical knowledge I have gained in this module
 over the semester.

== Project: OwlMoney
*OwlMoney* is an application designed to assist undergraduates and fresh graduates to track and manage their finances
conveniently and effectively - all in one place. *OwlMoney* provides a Command Line Interface (CLI) for the user to
interact with. The commands used to interact with *OwlMoney* are designed to be simple and intuitive. Rest assured, you
will be able to use *OwlMoney* with ease, even if you are unfamiliar with CLI.

The following 3 symbols will be used throughout the documentation which you may wish to pay attention to as it may

== Summary of Contributions
Below are my contributions in terms of feature enhancements, project management, and documentation:

=== Features Enhancement

==== Enhancement Added: `card` Feature
* *What it does*: Allows the users to maintain a list of credit cards that they own.

* *Justification*: The `card` feature work together with the `cardExpenditure` feature and provides the user the
capability of tracking their expenses for each credit card that they own. As such, provides the user with a convenient
way to review their credit card expenses.

* *Highlights*: This enhancement involves adding several new commands to *OwlMoney*. As such it requires an
understanding of the underlying architecture and the components `logic`, `model` and `storage`.

* *Credits*: The implementation of `card` feature was collaborated with
link:https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2113T-W17-3/main/blob/master/docs/team/terencetanwt.adoc[Tan Wee Theng Terence], as
there is a dependency between the `card` and `cardExpenditure` features.

==== Enhancement Added: `find` Feature
* *What it does*: Allows the user to search for specific information such as transaction records, bank account and more.

* *Justification*: It can be messy and tedious for the user to track and manage their finances after using *OwlMoney*
for some time. This is because the user might have thousand of transactions record stored within *OwlMoney*. With the
 `find` feature, it allows the user to search and view specific transaction records with ease.

* *Highlights*: For this enhancement to be implemented, it depends on other features such
 as `card`, `bank`, and `transaction`. Therefore, the implementation of `find` feature was challenging as it requires an
 in-depth analysis and understanding of other features.

==== Enhancement Added: `transfer` Feature
* *What it does*: Allows the users to transfer funds from one bank account to another account.

* *Justification*:  It provides the user with great flexibility to transfer funds from one bank account to another bank
account. This helps to simulate a realistic flow of funds between different accounts such as transferring money from
saving account to investment account to invest.

* *Highlights*: For this enhancement to be implemented, it depends on other features such
 as `bank` and `transaction`. Therefore, the implementation of `transfer` feature was challenging as it requires an
 in-depth analysis and understanding of other features.

==== Enhancement Added: `Ui` Feature
* *What it does*: Allows the users to list their financial information in a neat and tidy table format.

* *Justification*: By listing the financial information such as transaction records or bank account details in a table
 format, it allows the user to review the information with ease. Hence, making our application user-friendly for the
 user.

* *Highlights*: For this enhancement to be implemented, it depends on all other features such
 as `bank`, `transaction`, and `goals`. Therefore, the implementation of `Ui` feature was challenging as it requires
 an in-depth analysis and understanding of other features.

== Contributions to the User Guide

The following sections below showcase extracts of my contributions to the User Guide and my ability to write
documentation targeting end-users with little or no technical knowledge. In this section, it will only
showcase part of the `find` feature due to the page limit restriction. You can find more information about other
features implemented by me
link:https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2113T-W17-3/main/blob/master/docs/UserGuide.adoc[here].

=== Finding Command: `/find`
The `/find` command allows the user to search for different kinds of information which will be demonstrated in this
section.

Below is a list of command parameters that you can expect to use for the `/find` command in this section.
[cols="18%,37%,45%"]
|======
|*Parameter*| *Description* | *Acceptable Range of Values*
| `ACCOUNT_NAME`
| Indicates the name of the bank account.

(e.g. DBB Vickers Account)

| `ACCOUNT_NAME` should contain alphabetic characters, numeric characters, and spaces only.

`ACCOUNT_NAME` is case-sensitive.

Take note that there is a maximum of *30* character limit.

| `DESCRIPTION`
| Indicates the description of the transaction.
| `DESCRIPTION` should contain alphabetic characters, numeric characters, and spaces only.

Take note that there is a maximum of *50* character limit.

| `CATEGORY`
| Indicates the category of the transaction.
| `CATEGORY` should contain alphabetic characters, and spaces only.

Take note that there is a maximum of *15* character limit.

| `DATE`
| Indicates the date the transaction was made.

(e.g. 2/2/2019)

| `DATE` should be in *DD/MM/YYYY* format and cannot be a newer date than the current date.

Take note that there is a maximum of *50* character limit.

==== Finding Savings Account Details: `/find /savings`

Scenario: Let's say that you can only recall part of your savings account's name and would like to find out the
details of the savings account. Don't worry *OwlMoney* allows you to find it with ease.

Command Syntax: `/find /savings /name ACCOUNT_NAME`

[NOTE]
====
`ACCOUNT_NAME` used for searching is case-insensitive.
====

Command Example: `/find /savings /name Jun`

The command example allows the user to find and list all savings account that matches the keyword "Jun". This can
be seen from Figure 2 below.

==== Finding Bank Transaction: `/find /banktransaction`

Scenario: Let's say that you have thousands of bank transaction records and you want to find the
details of a specific bank transaction's records. Don't worry *OwlMoney* allows you to find it with ease.

Command Syntax: `/find /banktransaction /name ACCOUNT_NAME [/desc DESCRIPTION] [/from DATE /to DATE] [/category
CATEGORY]`

[NOTE]
====
Transactions includes both expenditures and deposits.

`DESCRIPTION` used for searching is case-insensitive.

`CATEGORY` used for searching is case-insensitive.
====

[WARNING]
====
The parameter within the square bracket (E.g. `[/desc DESCRIPTION]``) is optional in the command. However, at least one
of `/desc`, `/category`, or `/from` with `/to` must be used to make it a valid command.
====

Command Example: `/find /banktransaction /name JunBank Savings Account /desc bubble tea`

The command example allows the user to find and list all transaction records that match the description `bubble tea`
charged to `JunBank Savings Account`.

== Contributions to the Developer Guide

The following sections below showcase extracts of my contributions to the Developer Guide and my ability to write
documentation targeting end-users with little or no technical knowledge. In this section, it will only
showcase the `find` feature due to the page limit restriction. You can find more information about other features
implemented by me
link:https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2113T-W17-3/main/blob/master/docs/DeveloperGuide.adoc[here].

=== Design for `find` Feature

.Find Command Class Diagram
image::LogicCommandFindPackage.png[width="800"]

The `logic.command.find` package consist of `Find` classes with the ability to find any:

* Bank accounts
* Cards
* Bonds
* Card transactions
* Bank transactions
* Recurring Expenditures

`Main` will call the specific `Find` command class that will construct the *required parameters* before calling the
`Profile` class in `Model` to *execute*.

=== Implementation for `find` feature
The following section describes the specific implementation for *finding of the savings account* and how data flows
across various objects and methods to obtain a successful execution. In this section, we will be showcasing the data
flow of finding a savings account.

==== Finding of Savings Account

The `/find /savings` feature aims to provide the user with the ability to search for a savings account that matches the
keyword specified by the user. This enables the user to have great flexibility to view their savings account details
without the need of memorising each of their savings account names within *OwlMoney*. By allowing the user to search for
 a specific savings account, it also aids in the operation of editing or deleting of savings account.

===== Current Implementation
The current implementation of finding `savings` account only allows the user to search through the account name. The
reason to only allow the user to search through the account name was that searching through parameters such as income
may be inaccurate, as a user income may change over time resulting in inconsistency in the search.


.Sequence Diagram of finding savings account
image::FindSequenceDiagram.png[Caption="Figure : "]

[NOTE]
The sequence diagram presented above is assumed to be a valid command which will produce a successful result.

The sequence diagram presented above depicts the interaction between the `Logic`, `Model` and `Ui` component for running
`FindBankOrCardCommand`.

The `FindBankOrCardCommand` requires *2* inputs:

* The name of the account that acts as a keyword for the search.
* Type of item to be searched (e.g. `card`, `savings` or `investment`)

When the user executes the `FindBankOrCardCommand` to search for savings account, the following steps are taken by the
application:

. When the `FindBankOrCardCommand` is executed, it will invoke `findBankOrCard`.
. Once invoked, `findBankOrCard` will perform the following checks:

* Check the type of items to be searched is either `card`, `savings` or `investment`.

[start=3]
. After passing the above checks, `findBankOrCard` will invoke `findBankAccount`.
. Within the invocation of `findBankAccount`, it will perform the following checks:

* Check for matching account name with the keyword among all accounts stored in the ArrayList.
* Check whether the account that matches the keyword is indeed a savings account.

[NOTE]
`findBankAccount` will throw an error if all bank accounts within the application fail the above checks.

[start=5]
. Once the search has been completed, the details of all matching savings account will be displayed to inform the
user of the *successful* matches.

=== Design Considerations

This section describes the various design considerations taken when implementing the `/find` feature.

*Aspect: Choice of whether the keyword (E.g. `ACCOUNT_NAME`, `DESCRIPTION` or `CATEGORY`) to be searched should be
case-sensitive or case-insensitive*

[cols="18%,37%,45%"]
|======
| *Approach* | *Pros* | *Cons*

| *1.* Searching of items based on the keyword is case-sensitive.

a| * By restricting the search to be case-sensitive, it provides the user with a more accurate searched result.

a| * By having a case-sensitive search, it will cause the `/find` command to be inflexible. As the user will need to
provide the exact capitalisation within the keyword to be able to find the item he/she is searching for.

* For example, if the description of a transaction record that the user is searching for is "Lunch at KFC". The user
will not be able to find the expenditure if he/she provides the keyword as "lunch". This is because of the
capitalisation of the first letter within the keyword is "l" and it is different from the expenditure description.


| *2.* Searching of items based on the keyword is case-insensitive.

a| * By allowing the search to be case-insensitive, it provides the user with greater flexibility when searching for
matching items.


a| * For example, if the description of a transaction record that the user is searching for is "Lunch at KFC". The user
 will be able to find the transaction record if he/she provides the keyword as "lunch". This is because the
 capitalisation of the keyword does not matter.
|======

After weighing the pros and cons, *approach 2* was taken.

The reason for choosing *approach 2* over approach 1 is mainly due to the flexibility that it can provide to a user.
Although, searching for the item with case insensitivity might cause more unwanted results being displayed. We felt that
 the ability to easily match keyword with the item that the user would like to find is more important, as it enhanced
 the user-friendliness of OwlMoney.
