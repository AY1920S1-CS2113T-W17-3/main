== 1. Overview
This portfolio documents my contributions towards *OwlMoney* for the module CS2113T Software Engineering &
Object-Oriented Programming. It aims to demonstrate the theoretical and practical knowledge I have gained in this module
 over the semester.

== 2. Project: OwlMoney
*OwlMoney* is an application designed to assist undergraduates and fresh graduates to track and manage their finances
conveniently and effectively - all in one place. *OwlMoney* provides a Command Line Interface (CLI) for the user to
interact with. The commands used to interact with *OwlMoney* are designed to be simple and intuitive. Rest assured, you
will be able to use *OwlMoney* with ease, even if you are unfamiliar with CLI.

The following 3 symbols will be used throughout the documentation which you may wish to pay attention to as it may
contain important details:

== 3. Summary of contributions
Below are my contributions in terms of feature enhancements, project management, and documentation:

=== 3.1 Features enhancement

==== 3.1.1 Enhancement added: *Card* feature
* *What it does*: Allows the users to maintain a list of credit cards that they own.

* *Justification*: The *Card* feature work together with the *Card Expenditure* feature and provides the user the
capability of tracking their expenses for each credit card that they own. As such, provides the user with a convenient
way to review their credit card expenses.

* *Highlights*: This enhancement involves adding several new commands to *OwlMoney*. As such it requires an
understanding of the underlying architecture and the components `logic`, `model` and `storage`.

==== 3.1.2 Enhancement added: *Find* feature
* *What it does*: Allows the user to search for specific information such as transaction records, bank account and more.

* *Justification*: It can be messy and tedious for the user to track and manage their finances after using *OwlMoney*
for some time. This is because the user might have thousand of transactions record stored within *OwlMoney*. With the
 *Find* feature, it allows the user to search and view specific transaction records with ease.

* *Highlights*: For this enhancement to be implemented, it depends on other features such
 as *Card*, *Bank*, and *Transaction*. Therefore, the implementation of *Find* feature was challenging as it requires an
 in-depth analysis and understanding of other features.

=== 3.1.3 Enhancement added: *Transfer* feature
* *What it does*: Allows the users to transfer funds from one bank account to another account.

* *Justification*:  It provides the user with great flexibility to transfer funds from one bank account to another bank
account. This helps to simulate a realistic flow of funds between different accounts such as transferring money from
saving account to investment account to invest.

* *Highlights*: For this enhancement to be implemented, it depends on other features such
 as *Bank* and *Transaction*. Therefore, the implementation of *Transfer* feature was challenging as it requires an
 in-depth analysis and understanding of other features.

=== 3.1.4 Enhancement added: *Display* feature
* *What it does*: Allows the users to list their financial information in a neat and tidy table format.

* *Justification*: By listing the financial information such as transaction records or bank account details in a table
 format, it allows the user to review the information with ease. Hence, making our application user-friendly for the
 user.

* *Highlights*: For this enhancement to be implemented, it depends on all other features such
 as *Bank*, *Transaction*, and *Goal*. Therefore, the implementation of *Display* feature was challenging as it requires
 an in-depth analysis and understanding of other features.

== 4. Contributions to the User Guide

The following sections below showcase extracts of my contributions to the User Guide and my ability to write
documentation targeting end-users with little or no technical knowledge. In this section, it will only
showcase the *Find* feature due to the page limit restriction. You can find more information about other features
implemented by me

=== 4.1 Finding Command: `/find`
This command allows the user to find different kind of information which will be demonstrated below:

==== 4.1.1 Finding savings account details `/find /savings`

Scenario: Let's say that you can only recall part of your savings account's name and would like to find out the
details of the savings account. Don't worry *OwlMoney* allows you to find it with ease.

Command Example: `/find /savings /name Jun`

The command example allows the user to find and list all savings account that matches the keyword "Jun". This can
be seen from Figure 2 below.

==== 4.1.3 Finding bond details `/find /bonds`

Scenario: Let's say that you can only recall part of your bond's name and would like to find out the
details of the bond. Don't worry *OwlMoney* allows you to find it with ease.

Command Example: `/find /bonds /name SSB /from DBB Vickers Account`

The command example allows the user to find and list all bonds within DBB Vicker Account that matches the
keyword "SSB". This can be seen from Figure 5 below.

==== 4.1.3 Finding bank transaction `/find /banktransaction`

Scenario: Let's say that you have thousands of bank transaction records and you want to find the
details of a specific bank transaction's records. Don't worry *OwlMoney* allows you to find it with ease.

Command Example: `/find /banktransaction /name JunBank Savings Account /desc bubble tea /from 1/1/2019 /to 7/1/2019
/category food`

The command example allows the user to find and list all savings account that matches the keyword "DBB". This can
be seen from Figure 6 below.

Keyword use for description and category is case-insensitive, providing users greater flexibility during the
search.

The date range for /from and /to is inclusive of the date specified.

The search will list transaction records that match with either one of the parameters; description, category or date
range.

== 5. Contributions to the Developer Guide

The following sections below showcase extracts of my contributions to the Developer Guide and my ability to write
documentation targeting end-users with little or no technical knowledge. In this section, it will only
showcase the *Find* feature due to the page limit restriction. You can find more information about other features
implemented by me
link:https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2113T-W17-3/main/blob/master/docs/DeveloperGuide.adoc[here].

=== 5.1 Design for Find Feature

.Find Command Class Diagram
image::classdiagram.png[caption="Figure 8: "]

The `logic.command.find` package consist of `Find` classes with the ability to find any:

* Bank account
* Cards
* Bonds
* Card transaction
* Bank transaction

`Main` will call the specific `Find` command class that will construct the *required parameters* before calling the
`Profile` class in `Model` to *execute*.

=== 5.2 Implementation for Find feature
The following section describes the specific implementation for the *finding of savings account* and how data flows
across
various objects and methods to obtain a successful execution. In this section, we will be showcasing the data flow of
finding a savings account.

.Sequence Diagram for finding savings account
image::sequencediagram.png[caption="Figure 9: "]

[NOTE]
The sequence diagram presented above is assumed to be a valid command which will produce a successful result.

The above sequence diagram depicts the interaction between the `Logic`, `Model` and `Ui` component for running
`FindBankOrCardCommand`.

The `FindBankOrCardCommand` requires *2* inputs:

* Savings Account's name that acts as a keyword for the search.
* Type of item to be searched (e.g. cards, savings or investment account)

When the user executes the `FindBankOrCardCommand`, the following steps are taken by the application:

. When the `FindBankOrCardCommand` is executed, it will invoke `findBankOrCard`.
. Once invoked, `findBankOrCard` will perform the following checks:

* Check the type of items to be searched is either card, savings or investment account.

[start=3]
. After passing the above checks, `findBankOrCard` will invoke `findBankAccount`.
. Within the invocation of `findBankAccount`, it will perform the following checks:

* Check for matching savings account's name with the keyword among all savings account stored in the ArrayList.
* Check whether the savings account that matches the keyword is indeed a savings account.

[NOTE]
`findBankAccount` will throw an error if all bank accounts within the application fail the above checks.

[start=5]
. Once the search has been completed, the details of the all matching savings account will be displayed to inform the
user of the *successful* matches.
