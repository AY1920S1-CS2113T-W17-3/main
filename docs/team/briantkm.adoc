== PROJECT: OwlMoney

Hello there I am Brian. I am a current student from National University of Singapore. I am currently pursuing a
degree in Information Security.

I have collaborated with
link:{repoURL}/blob/master/docs/team/shamussy.adoc[Shamus Neo Zhi Kai],
link:{repoURL}/blob/master/docs/team/mong-nus.adoc[Mong Zheng Wei],
link:{repoURL}/blob/master/docs/team/terencetanwt.adoc[Tan Wee Theng, Terence]
and link:{repoURL}/blob/master/docs/team/valerietyj.adoc[Valerie Tan Yi Jia]
to work on a project for the module CS2113T (Software Engineering & Object-Oriented Programming).

=== About the project
My team and I were tasked to enhance a basic command line interface desktop personal assistance, named Duke, for our
project. We have decided to morph it into a finance tracker, which mainly targets undergraduates and fresh graduates, called OwlMoney.
This morphed product allows the users to keep track of their finances, while also allowing them to set goals for themselves to achieve.
This is what our project looks like:

My role was to design and implement the `add`, `edit`, `delete` and `list` functions for the `Savings` account,
`expenditures`, `deposit` and recurring bank expenditures, `recurbankexp`. The following sections illustrates these implementations in more detail, as well as the relevant documentation I have added to the User Guide and Developer Guide in relation to these implementations.

=== Summary of contributions
This section shows the summary of my contributions to the project which include the coding, documentation and other helpful contributions.

*Features implemented:* I have implemented the ability to `add`, `edit`, `delete` and `list` `Savings` account

* What it does: The `add`, `edit`, `delete` and `list` commands on a `savings` account allows the user to manage all
savings accounts in the profile.
* Justification: The savings account is a common account that many users own. Additionally, many transactions are
performed in this account. Because of these reasons, the implementation of the `Savings` account will cater to a
large number of users.
* Highlights: The bank account also keeps track of the user's monthly income so that it can automatically be credited
into the `Savings` account. This prevents errors such as forgetting to add a deposit for the monthly income.
* Credits: A majority of this class inherits from the parent class `bank` which was collaborated by

and link:{repoURL}/blob/master/docs/team/valerietyj.adoc[Valerie Tan Yi Jia]
.

*Features implemented:* I have implemented the ability to `add`, `edit`, `delete` and `list` transactions, which consists of
`expenditures`, `deposit`, and `recurbankexp`.

* What it does: The `add`, `edit`, `delete` and `list` commands on transaction objects allows the user to manage all
transactions within the bank or card accounts.
* Justification: Transactions which are performed on a bank account will affect the amount of money in it. By
implementing the transactions features, the user will be able to add any transactions which has been performed to the
specified bank account. This enables the ability to track the user's finances.
* Highlights: This enhancement automatically adjusts the current amount in the bank automatically when a transaction
is added, modified or deleted. This allows effective tracking of the user's finances in the account without the need
to manually edit the bank amount.
