== Shamus Neo Zhi Kai - Project Portfolio for OwlMoney

Hello there, I am __Shamus__.
I am currently pursuing a degree in Information Security at the National University of Singapore (NUS). +
I enjoy server and network administration as well as building and breaking applications.

This portfolio serves to document my extensive involvement and contribution in a team-based project CS2113T (Software
Engineering & Object-Oriented Programming) module by NUS.
This project spans over a period of about eight weeks, and was completed together with a team of five members
(consisting of <<mong-nus#,Mong Zheng Wei>>, <<briantkm#,Brian Tan Kian Ming>>, <<terencetanwt#,Terence Tan Wee Theng>>,
<<valerietyj#,Valerie Tan Yi Jia>> and myself).

=== About the project

My team and I were tasked with enhancing a basic Command Line Interface (CLI) based personal assistant, named Duke
for our Software Engineering Project. We chose to morph it into a financial tracker and management application called
*OwlMoney*. This enhanced application targets undergraduates and fresh graduates and aims to help them track and manage
their finances. Some features of *OwlMoney* include tracking of both expenses and expenditures as well as tracking
credit cards and investments such as investment bonds. +
My role as a team leader was to perform project management as well as to write the baseline code for the team to get
started. On top of that, I was also in charge of writing codes for the `investment`, `bonds`, `storage` and
some parts of the `commands` section. +
The following sections illustrates these enhancements in more details,
illustrates the relevant sections I have contributed to the project as a whole, as well as the relevant sections I have added to the
user and developer guides in relation to these enhancements.

=== Summary of Contributions
This section shows a summary of my coding, documentation, and other helpful contributions to the team project.

*Enhancement added:* I added the ability to add `investment` accounts and `bonds`.

* *What it does:* The `investment` account allows the user to create an account specially dedicated for `investment`
purposes.

* *Justification:* As we are targeting undergraduates and fresh graduates who usually do not have good financial
literacy, I believe that *OwlMoney* can play a role in educating them on separating spending from `investment`.
Therefore, no spending transactions can be made on the `investment` account and no investments can be bought in a
savings account.

* *Highlights:* This enhancement automatically credits interest for `bonds` added into the `investment` account every
*6* months from the date of purchase, eliminating the need for the user to manually calculate and enter the interest
in every half-yearly. This prevents errors caused by users forgetting to enter the interest since the interest only
credits twice a year.

* *Credits:* A portion of recording `transactions` and similar features across all bank accounts were inherited from
a common parent class `bank` which was coded by both <<briantkm#,Brian Tan Kian Ming>> and I.

*Other contributions:*

* *Project Management:*

** There were a total of 4 releases, from version 1.0 to version 1.3. I managed the team's repository and was
responsible for producing all of the releases on Github.

* *Enhancements to existing features:*

** Updated the persistent storage to use `OpenCSV` instead of writing into a conventional `.txt` file. This provides
better clarity and organisation of stored data in secondary storage.

* *Documentation:*

** Responsible for maintaining *over 70%* of content on both the *User Guide* and *Developer Guide* as well as making
it presentable in the `.adoc` format which can be rendered and converted to various other formats since it is
platform independent.

* *Community:*
** Contributed to *forum discussions* (examples: PRs link:{forumURL}/61[#61], link:{forumURL}/60[#60],
link:{forumURL}/57[#57], link:{forumURL}/26[#26], link:{forumURL}/8[#8])

** Reported bugs (examples: PRs link:{forumURL}/11[#11])

* *Tools:*

** Integrated a third party library http://opencsv.sourceforge.net/[OpenCSV] to the project for persistent `storage`.
** Integrated https://travis-ci.org/AY1920S1-CS2113T-W17-3/main[Travis]
& https://ci.appveyor.com/project/shamussy/main[AppVeyor] *Continuous Integration (CI)* tools.
(examples: PRs {prURL}/119[#119])
** Integrated https://coveralls.io/github/AY1920S1-CS2113T-W17-3/main[Coveralls]
& https://codecov.io/gh/AY1920S1-CS2113T-W17-3/main[Codecov] *Code coverage* tools. (examples: PRs {prURL}/133[#133])
** Integrated https://app.codacy.com/manual/OwlMoney/main/dashboard[Codacy] *Code analytics* tool.
** Integrated https://app.netlify.com/sites/ay1920s1-cs2113t-w17-3/deploys[Netlify]
& https://github.com/shamussy/main/deployments[GitHub Deployment] *Deployment preview* tool to the
team's repository (examples: PRs {prURL}/119[#119], {prURL}/101[#101], {prURL}/103[#103])
** Updated *Gradle build configuration* to automate and simplify the build process
(examples: PRs link:{prURL}/101[#101])
** Added a new *Github plugin* (https://github.com/apps/project-bot[project-bot]) to automate triaging of issues in
the team's link:{repoURL}/projects/[Project Board]
