= *Valerie Tan* - Project Portfolio for OwlMoney

Hello I am Valerie, currently pursuing Information Security in the National University of Singapore (NUS).

This portfolio aims to provide a detailed outline of my contributions during the development of our group's
application, *OwlMoney*.
We are a team of five, led by<<shamussy#,Shamus Neo Zhi Kai>> and comprises of <<briantkm#,Brian Tan Kian Ming>>,
<<mong-nus#,Mong Zheng Wei>>, <<terencetan#, Terence Tan Wee Kheng>> and <<valerietyj#,myself>>.

== About the project
[.underline]*OwlMoney* is specially created and developed for our Software Engineering
and Object-Oriented Project, focused on designing and implementing a command-line based personal assistant.

We decided to name it [.underline]*OwlMoney* as it equipped with the mission to help Undergraduates / Fresh Graduates
manage and *_track their finances efficiently, effectively, and more conveniently._*

At first start, OwlMoney provides users with a fresh look and thereafter, a
direct way of entering and accessing the features in OwlMoney:

My main responsibility when developing this application was to implement and
design the code for `goals` feature. Following sections will illustrate in
details my contribution as one of *OwlMoney's* Developer for the past 8-weeks.

=== Enhancement added
`goals` features functionality for users to `add`, `delete`, `edit` and `list` financial goals.
OwlMoney users have a choice of linking their saving accounts to the goals added to better facilitate tracking of
their goals progress.

What `add goals` does::
The `add` goals command allows user to enter a new goal. The user may choose to link their savings account by specifying
`/from` parameter with a valid savings account. User also has the option to specify their goals deadline using `in`
(days) or `from` (date) parameter.

What `edit goals` does::
The `edit` goals command enables users to change any valid input parameter if there are any changes to the goals they
have added. In addition, if user has not linked any savings account, they can also do it here by
specifying `/from` parameter.

What `delete goals` does::
In the event when a goal is no longer relevant, the `delete` goals command deletes the specified goals.

What `list goals` does::
Listing of all financial goals user has set.

Justification of features added::
Our target users for OwlMoney are Fresh Graduates / Undergraduates, these features stated above were necessary to
model real-life setting of having goals and target.

Highlights::
`goals` works well with future implementations and enhancement for OwlMoney such as linking to other accounts or
unlocking new achievements.

`goals` are meant to motivate users to save and properly manage their finances for any financial goals that they wish
to achieve. There were several challenges faced due to design considerations of `goals`.

Credits::
Collaborated with <<briantkm#, Brian Tan Kian Ming>> on the linking of user's goal to savings account.
