== Introduction

*OwlMoney* is a command line based desktop application written in *Java 11*. It is written in an *Object Oriented
Programming* (OOP) fashion which provides multiple layers of abstraction for ease of customisability and modularity
for future improvements and revisions.
Interested in contributing to the *OwlMoney* project? This guide provides information that will not only help you
get started as a *OwlMoney* contributor, but you'll find useful to refer to even if you are already an experienced
contributor.

== Setting up

The sub-sections below introduces the prerequisites and steps required to get you started quickly so that you can
start developing on this project quickly!

=== Prerequisites
. *JDK `11`*
+
[NOTE]
Only JDK 11 is officially supported
. *IntelliJ* IDE
+
[NOTE]
IntelliJ by default has Gradle plugins installed. +
Do not disable it. If you have disabled Gradle, go to `File` > `Settings` > `Plugins` to re-enable it.

=== Setting up the project in your computer
. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer
. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen,
click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project dialog first)
. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle
.. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`
.. Click `New...` and find the directory of the JDK
. Click `Import Project`
. Locate the `build.gradle` file and select it. Click `OK`
. Click `Open as Project`
. Click `OK` to accept the default settings
. Open a console and run the command `gradlew processResources` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew processResources`).
It should finish with the `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` message. +
This will generate all resources required by the application and tests.

=== Verifying the setup

. Run `owlmoney.Main` and try a few commands
. <<Testing,Run the tests>> to ensure they all pass.

=== Configurations to do before writing code

Before you get down and dirty and start writing code, the configurations below can ease your burden and fix common
syntax and styling issues! Configure them and you will notice the benefits in the long run!

==== Configuring the coding style

This project follows https://github.com/oss-generic/process/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.adoc[oss-generic coding standards]. IntelliJ's default style is mostly compliant with ours but it uses a different import order from ours. To rectify,

. Go to `File` > `Settings...` (Windows/Linux), or `IntelliJ IDEA` > `Preferences...` (macOS)
. Select `Editor` > `Code Style` > `Java`
. Click on the `Imports` tab to set the order

* For `Class count to use import with '\*'` and `Names count to use static import with '*'`: Set to `999` to prevent IntelliJ from contracting the import statements
* For `Import Layout`: The order is `import static all other imports`, `import java.\*`, `import javax.*`, `import org.\*`, `import com.*`, `import all other imports`. Add a `<blank line>` between each `import`

Optionally, you can follow the <<UsingCheckstyle#, UsingCheckstyle.adoc>> document to configure Intellij to check style-compliance as you write code.

==== Updating documentation to match your fork

After forking the repo, the documentation will still have the OwlMoney branding.

If you plan to develop this fork as a separate product, you should do the following:

. Configure the <<Docs-SiteWideDocSettings, site-wide documentation settings>> in link:{repoURL}/build.gradle[`build.gradle`], such as the `site-name`, to suit your own project.

. Replace the URL in the attribute `repoURL` in link:{repoURL}/docs/DeveloperGuide.adoc[`DeveloperGuide.adoc`] and link:{repoURL}/docs/UserGuide.adoc[`UserGuide.adoc`] with the URL of your fork.

==== Setting up CI

Set up Travis to perform Continuous Integration (CI) for your fork. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to set it up.

After setting up Travis, you can optionally set up coverage reporting for your team fork (see <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Coverage reporting could be useful for a team repository that hosts the final version but it is not that useful for your personal fork.

Optionally, you can set up AppVeyor as a second CI (see <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Having both Travis and AppVeyor ensures your App works on both Unix-based platforms and Windows-based platforms (Travis is Unix-based and AppVeyor is Windows-based)

==== Getting started with coding

When you are ready to start coding,

1. Get some sense of the overall design by reading <<Design-Architecture>>.


== Design

The following section explains the design of *OwlMoney*.

It is described in a top-down approach to start you off with a broader view of the entire application before going into
the specific implementations of the individual features.

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture
.Architecture Diagram
image::Architecture.png[width="600"]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App.
Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.pptx` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder.
To update a diagram, modify the diagram in the `.pptx` file, select the objects of the diagram, and choose `Save as
picture`.

`Main` has only one class called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/owlmoney/Main.java[`Main`]. It is
responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
The following class plays an important role at the architecture level:

* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to *OwlMoney's* log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

=== UI Component
.Ui Component Diagram
image::UiComponent.png[width="800"]

The `Ui` is responsible for printing output in a *user-friendly* manner and prints out changes made to `Model` by
`Logic`.

=== Logic Component
.High Level Logic Diagram
image::HighLevelLogic.png[width="800"]

* The `logic` package consists of the `parser`, `command` and `regex` packages.
* The `parser` package contains classes that are responsible for parsing user commands.
* The parser classes will make use of the `RegexUtil` stored in the `regex` package to verify the correctness of user
input and will return a `Command` object back to `Main` upon determining the validity of the input which is
explained in *Figure 4*.

==== Parser

.General Parser Class Diagram
image::HighLevelLogicParser.png[width="800"]

* The `Logic.parser` package consists of `Parser`, `ParseCommand`, `ParseType`, `ParseRawData` and the *abstract*
`Parser` classes that more specific parsers will inherit from.
* The `Parser` class provides *general methods* that more specific parser classes will *require*.
* The `ParseCommand` class parses the action from the user input (e.g. `/add`, `/delete`, `/edit`), before passing the user
input to the `ParseType` class for further parsing.
* The `ParseType` class will continue to parse the type of user input (e.g. `/card`, `/bank`), before passing the user input
to a more specific `Parser` class (e.g. `ParseAddCard` under the abstract class `ParseCard` which is not shown here) for further sophisticated parsing.
* The specific parser classes will then call `ParseRawData` to extract required parameters based on the Command and Type
that was determined earlier in `ParseCommand` and `ParseType` previously.
* The specific parser class will also check the correctness of the extracted parameters by using `RegexUtil` stored
in the `regex` package which is also part of the `logic` package as shown in *Figure 3*. After which, the parser class
will proceed to create an instance of the appropriate command class and return it back to `Main`.

==== Command

.Bank Command Class Diagram
image::LogicCommandBankPackage.png[width="800"]

The `logic.command.bank` package consist of `Savings` and `Investment` classes which inherits from the `Command` class.

Both the `Savings` and `Investments` classes have the following common features:

* Add
* Edit
* Delete
* List

`Main` will call the specific `Savings` or `Investment` command class that will construct the *required
parameters* before calling the `Profile` class in `Model` to *execute*.

// tag::bonds_class_diagram[]

.Bond Command Class Diagram
image::LogicCommandBondPackage.png[width="800"]

The `logic.command.bond` package consist of `Bond` classes with the following features:

* Add
* Edit
* Delete
* List

`Main` will call the specific `Bond` command class that will construct the *required parameters* before calling the
`Profile` class in `Model` to *execute*.

// end::bonds_class_diagram[]

.Card Command Class Diagram
image::LogicCommandCardPackage.png[width="800"]

The `logic.command.card` package consist of `Card` classes with the following features:

* Add
* Edit
* Delete
* List

`Main` will call the specific `Card` command class that will construct the *required parameters* before calling the
`Profile` class in `Model` to *execute*.

// tag::goals_class[]
.Goals Command Class Diagram
image::LogicCommandGoalsPackage.png[width="800"]

The `logic.command.goals` package consist of `Goals` classes with the following features:

* Add
* Edit
* Delete
* List

`Main` will call the specific `Goal` command class that will construct the *required parameters* before calling the
`Profile` class in `Model` to *execute*.
// end::goals_class[]

.Find Command Class Diagram
image::LogicCommandFindPackage.png[width="800"]

The `logic.command.find` package consist of `Find` classes with the ability to find any:

* Bank accounts
* Cards
* Bonds
* Card transactions
* Bank transactions
* Recurring Expenditures

`Main` will call the specific `Find` command class that will construct the *required parameters* before calling the
`Profile` class in `Model` to *execute*.


.Transfer Command Class Diagram
image::LogicCommandTransferPackage.png[width="800"]

The Transfer Package under `logic.command.transfer` consist of the `TransferCommand` class which inherits from `Command`.

`Main` will call the `TransferCommand` class that will construct the *required parameters* before calling the `Profile`
class in `Model` to *execute*.


=== Model Component
.Model Component Diagram
image::ModelComponent.png[width="800"]

The `Model` contains multiple packages that is responsible for specifying the structures and constraints of the *core
functionalities* of *OwlMoney* as well as the storing of data of the application in memory.

In general, the `Model` contains the following packages:

* `bank` -> responsible for the savings and investment accounts.
* `bond` -> responsible for the investment bonds.
* `card` -> responsible for the credit cards.
* `goals` -> responsible for financial goals.
* `profile` -> responsible for the user profile.
* `transaction` -> responsible for expenditures and deposits which are classified under the umbrella term Transaction.

To execute any command, `Main` will invoke `profile.Profile` to execute commands.
`Profile` has access to each individual ArrayList such as `CardList`, `BankList`, `GoalList` that stores objects of
cards, bank accounts and financial goals respectively. Both `Card` and `Bank` objects each contains a `TransactionList`
which holds records of transactions.
If the `Card` or the `Bank` objects are *deleted*, its corresponding `TransactionList` that contains the records of
transactions *will be deleted* along with it given that it has a *composite relationship* with `TransactionList`.


=== Storage Component

The `Storage` component:

* can save user data in `.csv` format and read it back.

*OwlMoney* uses http://opencsv.sourceforge.net/[OpenCSV] during both importing and exporting data when acting on
`.csv` files.

This allows user to see and modify saved data easily, with the use of clearly defined columns.

=== Common Classes

Classes used by multiple components are in stored in the `commons` package. For example, the `logging` feature of
*OwlMoney* has its logging features centralised in `owlmoney.commons`.

== Implementation

The following section describes the specific implementation of each feature and how data flows across various `objects`
and `methods` to obtain a successful execution.

=== Parsing Commands in General
.Sequence Diagram of Parsing Commands
image::GeneralParsingSequenceDiagram.png[width="970]

[NOTE]
The sequence diagram presented above is assumed to be a valid command which will generate in a successful result.

The above sequence diagram depicts the general sequence of parsing user input for all commands in general, before going
into the the specific Parser classes in `ParseTypeMenu`.

Depending on the `type` of command the user enters, the specific parser class invoked will be different (e.g.
`ParseAddBond`, `ParseDeleteInvestment`) which will return a `Command` object back to main to prepare for execution.

The execution of commands will be elaborated in subsequent diagrams below.

// tag::add_savings[]

=== Adding Savings
.Sequence Diagram of Adding Savings
image::AddSavingCommand.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
The sequence diagram presented above is assumed to be a valid command which will generate in a successful result.

The above sequence diagram depicts the interaction between the `Logic` and `Model` component for running
`AddSavingsCommand`.

The `AddSavingsCommand` requires *3* inputs:

. Savings Account's name
. Amount
. Income

When the user executes the `AddSavingsCommand`, the following steps are taken by the application:

. When `AddSavingsCommand` is executed, it creates a new savings object using the *3* inputs.
. After creating the savings object, the `AddSavingsCommand` will invoke the method `profileAddNewBank`.
. Within the invocation of `profileAddNewBank`, a method `bankListAddBank` will be invoked to add the new savings object
to an Arraylist containing all bank objects.
. Once `bankListAddBank` is invoked, it will perform the following checks:

* Check if the bank name specified is unique among all bank accounts in the bank list through the method
`bankAccountExists`.

[NOTE]
`bankListAddBank` will throw an error if the above check fails.

[start=5]

. After passing the above checks, `bankListAddBank` will add the new savings object to the Arraylist which contains all
bank objects.
. Once the savings object has been added, the details of the new savings object will be displayed to inform the user
of the *successful* addition of the savings object.

// end::add_savings[]

// tag::editing_bonds[]

=== Editing Bonds

The `/edit /bonds` feature aims to help users update the specific details of the investment `bonds` that they
purchase. This is to enable them to not go through the trouble of deleting and re-adding the `bond` if they enter the
details wrongly by mistake.

==== Current Implementation

The current implementation of editing `bonds` only allows for the edition of `rate` and `year` where the `year`
parameter can only be changed to a higher integer than the original `year` currently stored. The reason behind only
allowing these *2* parameters to be changed was because we wanted consistency across all records of crediting
interest throughout the lifespan of the investment `bond`.

.Sequence Diagram of Editing Bonds
image::editBondCommand.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
The sequence diagram presented above is assumed to be a valid command which will produce a successful result.

The sequence diagram presented above depicts the interaction between the `Logic` and `Model` component for running
`EditBondCommand`.

The `EditBondCommand` requires a minimum of *3* and up to a maximum of *4* inputs:

. Investment Account's name
. Bond’s name
. *At least 1* of the *2* inputs:
.. Rate
.. Year of maturity

When the user executes the `EditBondCommand`, the following steps are taken by the application:

. When `EditBondCommand` is executed, it will invoke `profileEditBond`.
. Within the invocation of `profileEditBond`, a method named `bankListEditBond` will be invoked.
. Once invoked, `bankListEditBond` will perform the following checks based on the bank name specified:

* Check for the existence of the investment account containing the bond.

[NOTE]
`bankListEditBond` will throw an error if the above check fails.

[start=4]
. After passing the above checks, the method `investmentEditBond` will be invoked.
. Within `investmentEditBond`, the method named `editBond` will be invoked.
. Once invoked, `editBond` will perform the following checks:

* Check for the existence of the bond within the investment account.
* Check whether the newly specified year of maturity for the bond is more than or equal to the current year of
maturity through the method `editBondYear`.

[NOTE]
`editBond` will throw an error if the above check fails.

[start=7]
. After passing all of the above checks, `editBond` will update the bond details with the new details specified using:
* `editBondRate` -> edits bond's interest or coupon rate.
* `editBondYear` -> edits year of maturity.

. Once the bond object has been edited, the updated details of that bond object will be displayed to inform the user
of the *successful* editing of the bond.

==== Design Considerations

This section describes the various design considerations taken when implementing the `/edit /bonds` feature.

*Aspect: Choice of whether to allow editing of the bond to tie to which investment account as well as its name*
[cols="18%,37%,45%"]
|======
| *Approach* | *Pros* | *Cons*

| *1.* Allowing changing of the investment bank account that the bond ties to.

a| * More room for customisability from the user's perspective.

a| * Difficult to implement, have to take care of issues such as whether there is enough space to store bonds in
the other bank account.

* All transaction records have to be migrated over to the other bank account and might cause issues such as
transaction records not appearing in order.


| *2.* Allowing the changing of bond's name.

a| * Allows the user to change the name of the bond if the user entered it wrongly the first time.

a| * If interest has already been credited, it is not feasible to change the names of past records as it might cause
confusion to the end user. This becomes more apparent when the names clash with the name of another investment bond
which had expired prior to making this edit. This might confuse users as they might think that they earned much more
interest from the same bond.
a|

*3.* Disallowing the changing of both parameters.
a| * Easier to implement in terms of code.

* Users are less likely to get confused after editing records to become conflicting.

a|

* Less flexibility for the user.

|======

After weighting the pros and cons, *approach 3* was taken.

Firstly, doing so would reduce the coupling and dependencies between transactions and investment banks. Although it may
seem restrictive to limit the type and number of parameters that can be changed, it is beneficial both to you, the
developer and the user, when developing and using the program. Developing the alternative ideas would result in a
high risk of logic and coding errors, leaving room for bugs to be exploited.

// end::editing_bonds[]

=== Deleting Credit Card
.Model Component Diagram
image::DeleteCardCommand.png[width="970"]

[NOTE]
The sequence diagram presented above is assumed to be a valid command which will produce a successful result.

The above sequence diagram depicts the interaction between the `Logic` and `Model` component for running
`DeleteCardCommand`.

The `DeleteCardCommand` requires *1* input:

* Credit Card’s name.

When the user executes the `DeleteCardCommand`, the following steps are taken by the application:

. When `DeleteCardCommand` is executed, it will invoke `profileDeleteCard`.
. Within the invocation of `profileDeleteCard`, a method named `cardListDeleteCard` will be invoked.
. Once invoked, `cardListDeleteCard` will perform the following checks:

* Check the Arraylist containing all card objects is not empty through the method cardListCheckListEmpty .
* Check for the existence of the card with the specified name.

[NOTE]
`cardListDeleteCard` will throw an error if any of the above checks fail.

[start=4]
. After passing the above checks, `cardListDeleteCard` will delete the card with the specified name from the Arraylist.
. Once the card object has been deleted, the details of the deleted card object will be displayed to inform the user
of the *successful* deletion of the card object.


=== Listing Credit Cards
.Model Component Diagram
image::listCardCommand.png[width="970"]

[NOTE]
The sequence diagram presented above is assumed to be a valid command which will produce a successful result.

The above sequence diagram depicts the interaction between the `Logic` and `Model` component for running
`ListCardCommand`.

The `ListCardCommand` does not require any additional input.

When the user executes the `ListCardCommand`, the following steps are taken by the application:

. When the `ListCardCommand` is executed, it will invoke `profileListCard`.
. Within the invocation of `profileListCard`, a method name `cardListListCard` will be invoked.
. Once invoked, `cardListListCard` will perform the following checks:

* Check the arraylist containing the card objects is not empty through the method cardListCheckListEmpty.

[NOTE]
`cardListListCard` will throw an error if the above check fail.

[start=4]
. After passing the above checks, `cardListListCard` will display the details of each card within the Arraylist.

=== Transferring Funds
.Model Component Diagram
image::TransferCommand.png[width="970"]

[NOTE]
The sequence diagram presented above is assumed to be a valid command which will produce a successful result.

The above sequence diagram depicts the interaction between the `Logic` and `Model` component for running
`TransferCommand`.

The `TransferCommand` requires *4* inputs:

* Sender Bank Account's name
* Receiver Bank Account's name
* Date of transfer
* Amount to transfer

When the user executes the `TransferCommand`, the following steps are taken by the application:

. When the `TransferCommand` is executed, it will invoke `transferFund`.
. Once invoked, `transferFund` will perform the following checks:

* Check the transferring account exists in the Arraylist of banks through the method `bankListIsAccountExistToReceive`.
* Check the transferring account has sufficient money for the transfer through the method
`bankListIsSufficientForTransfer`.
* Check the receiving account exists in the arraylist of bank through the method `bankListIsAccountExistToReceive`.

[NOTE]
`transferFund` will throw an error if any of the above checks fail.

[start=3]
. After passing the above checks, `transferFund` will add an expenditure to the transferring account.
. After adding an *expenditure* to the transferring account, a *deposit* will be added to the receiving account for the
fund transfer.
. Once the transfer has been completed, the details of the transfer will be displayed to inform the user of the
*successful* fund transfer.

// tag::goals_sequence[]

=== Adding Goals

The `/add /goals` feature allows user to add in any financial goals they have in mind to achieve for their future plans.
This also aims to encourage users whom have yet to have savings to start saving  and track their goals.

==== Current Implementation

The current implementation of adding goals allow users to either manually track their goals or track via an existing
saving account. Also, the `/amount` parameter that user specify should be the total amount they wish to
have in their saving account.
The reason for providing these two options to users is that we consider that some users may prefer to do manual tracking
while others would prefer tracking them using an existing savings account.

.Sequence Diagram of Adding Goals
image::AddGoalsCommand.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
The sequence diagram presented above is assumed to be a valid command which will produce a successful result.

The sequence diagram presented above depicts the interaction between the `Logic` and `Model` component for running
`AddGoalsCommand`.

The `AddGoalsCommand` requires a minimum of *3* and up to a maximum of *4* inputs:

. Goal name
. Intended amount to save
. Date they wish to achieve the goal by
. *OPTIONAL* input:
.. Savings Account Name

When the user executes the `AddGoalsCommand`, the following steps are taken by the application:

. When `AddGoalsCommand` is executed, a new goal object is created  with the provided inputs.
. After creation of the goal object is created, the `AddGoalsCommand` will invoke the method `profileAddGoals`.
. Within the invocation of `profileAddGoals`, a method named `addToGoals` will be invoked to add the new goal object
to an ArrayList containing all goals objects. .
. Once invoked, `addToGoals` will perform the following checks:

* Checks if goal name specified is unique among all goals in the existing list through the method of `goalsExist`
* If a saving accounts was specified, it will check for if the amount of money in the account is lesser than the
goals amount specified
* Checks for the size of goals list through the method of `CheckNumGoals`

[NOTE]
`AddGoalsCommand` will throw an error if the above check fails.

[start=4]
. After passing the above checks,`addToGoals` will add the new goals object into the existing list containing all goals
objects.
. Once the goal object have been added, the details of the new goal object will be displayed to inform the user
of the *successful* addition of the goal object.

==== Design Considerations

This section describes the various design considerations taken when implementing the `/add /goals` feature.

*Aspect: Choice of whether to allow tying of savings account to a goals*
[cols="18%,37%,45%"]
|======
| *Approach* | *Pros* | *Cons*

| *1.* Allowing the option of tying of savings account

a| * Provides flexibility to users
* Able to track goals status and progress, know how much more to save
a| * Difficult to implement, have to consider several possibilities: what happens to the goals when
e.g. if savings account was deleted, if user are allowed to tie and untie savings account, un-tracked goals status would
be always false
* Increases coupling and dependency of savings account

| *2.* Disallow tying of savings account

a| * Easier to implement in terms of code
* Lesser considerations during the implementation of `/edit /goals`
a| * Less flexibility for the users
* The feature and importance of goals would be less evident

|======

*Approach 1* was taken after serious consideration and weighing out the pros and cons.

Firstly, the original intention of `goals` feature is to model real-life implementation of having goals,
encourages users to save and enable an easy yet convenient way of tracking on status of goals.
Although it may increase coupling and dependencies, the implementation of `goals` evidently shows that the pros
outweighs the cons despite these trade-offs.

// end::goals_sequence[]

== Documentation

We use asciidoc for writing documentation. We recommend you to document features that you have done to keep other
developers aware of your implementation.

Feel free to modify documentations of our original features as well!

[NOTE]
We chose asciidoc over Markdown because asciidoc,
although a bit more complex than Markdown, provides more flexibility in formatting.

=== Editing Documentation

See <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to render `.adoc` files locally to preview the end result of your edits.
Alternatively, you can download the AsciiDoc plugin for IntelliJ, which allows you to preview the changes you have made to your `.adoc` files in real-time.

=== Publishing Documentation

See <<UsingTravis#deploying-github-pages, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to deploy GitHub Pages using Travis.

=== Converting Documentation to PDF format

We use https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/[Google Chrome] for converting documentation to PDF format, as Chrome's PDF engine preserves hyperlinks used in webpages.

Here are the steps to convert the project documentation files to PDF format.

.  Follow the instructions in <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to convert the AsciiDoc files in the `docs/` directory to HTML format.
.  Go to your generated HTML files in the `build/docs` folder, right click on them and select `Open with` -> `Google Chrome`.
.  Within Chrome, click on the `Print` option in Chrome's menu.
.  Set the destination to `Save as PDF`, then click `Save` to save a copy of the file in PDF format. For best results, use the settings indicated in the screenshot below.

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS[CSS stylesheets] of the site.
You can modify them to change some properties of the site's design.

The files in link:{repoURL}/docs/templates[`docs/templates`] controls the rendering of `.adoc` files into HTML5.
These template files are written in a mixture of https://www.ruby-lang.org[Ruby] and http://slim-lang.com[Slim].

[WARNING]
====
Modifying the template files in link:{repoURL}/docs/templates[`docs/templates`] requires some knowledge and
experience with Ruby and Asciidoctor's API.
You should only modify them if you need greater control over the site's layout than what stylesheets can provide.
The SE-EDU team does not provide support for modified template files.

[[Testing]]
== Testing

Testing is integral to the success of *OwlMoney*. We perform tests regularly during the development of *OwlMoney* and
recommend you to be consistent with this ideology and do so too!

=== Running Tests

There are *2* ways to run tests.

*Method 1: Using IntelliJ JUnit test runner*

* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose `Run 'All Tests'`
* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose `Run 'ABC'`

*Method 2: Using Gradle*

* Open a console and run the command `gradlew clean allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean allTests`)

=== Types of tests

We have two types of tests:

.. _System Tests_ that test the *OwlMoney* by running base level automated tests on https://www.appveyor.com/[AppVeyor].
.. _Unit tests_ that test the individual components. These are in `test.java` package.
..  _Unit tests_ targeting the lowest level methods/classes. +
e.g. `owlmoney.model`
..  _Integration tests_ that are checking the integration of multiple code units (those code units are assumed to be
working). +
e.g. `owlmoney.model.bond.BondListTest`
..  Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These test are checking multiple code units as well as how the are
connected together. +
e.g. `owlmoney.model.bond.BondListTest`

== Dev Ops

Development and Operations (Dev Ops) is integral to ensure consistent releases and updates are produced to fix bugs
and introduce new features to *OwlMoney* while ensuring existing features do not break.
We use multiple tools to automate checks and ensure high levels of consistency across the board.

Below are configurations and services that were used during the development of *OwlMoney*.

=== Build Automation

See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to use Gradle for build automation.

=== Continuous Integration

We use https://travis-ci.org/[Travis CI] and https://www.appveyor.com/[AppVeyor] to perform _Continuous Integration_
on our projects.

See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> and <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>> for more details.

=== Coverage Reporting

We use https://coveralls.io/[Coveralls] to track the code coverage of our projects.

See <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>> for more details.

We use https://codecov.io/[Codecov] as well to provide an alternative perspective from coveralls.

See https://docs.codecov.io/docs[Codecov Quick Start] for more details.

=== Documentation Previews
When a pull request has changes to asciidoc files, you can use https://www.netlify.com/[Netlify] to see a preview of
how the HTML version of those asciidoc files will look like when the pull request is merged.

See <<UsingNetlify#, UsingNetlify.adoc>> for more details.

=== Making a Release

Here are the steps to create a new release.

.  Update the version number in link:{repoURL}/build.gradle[`build.gradle`].
.  Generate a JAR file <<UsingGradle#creating-the-jar-file, using Gradle>>.
.  Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v1.8`
.  https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/[Create a new release using GitHub] and upload the JAR file
you created.

=== Managing Dependencies

A project often depends on third-party libraries.

Managing these _dependencies_ can be automated using
Gradle.

For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which is better than these alternatives:

[loweralpha]
. Include those libraries in the repo (this bloats the repo size)
. Require developers to download those libraries manually (this creates extra work for developers)
